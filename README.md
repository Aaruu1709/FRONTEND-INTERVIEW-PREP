# Module 1: Execution Context, Hoisting & Scope

## Theory Questions
what is javascript?
1. Definition-
JavaScrip is a high-level, interpreted, and single-threaded programming language.
2. Main Purpose-
It is used to create interactive and dynamic web applications.
3. Where It Runs-
Earlier, it was used only in browsers, but now with Node.js, it can also run on the server side.
4. Features-
It supports object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming(program execution depends on button click, keyboard input).
5. Real Project Usage-
In projects, I have used it for DOM manipulation, API calls, asynchronous programming, and performance optimization.
Dom manupulation:changing or controlling HTML elements on a web page using JavaScript.
-High level-easy for humans to read, write, and understand.
-interpreter-code is executed line by line by a program
-single threaded-executes one task at a time.
functional-Instead of writing the same code again and again, we put it inside a function and call it whenever we need it.or  it is reusable piece of code

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔥 followup question:
If JavaScript is single-threaded, how does it handle asynchronous tasks?

"JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it executes one task at a time using a single call stack.

However, for asynchronous operations like API calls, timers, and DOM events, JavaScript uses Web APIs provided by the browser or APIs provided by Node.js.

When an async operation starts, JavaScript sends that task to these APIs and continues executing the remaining code without waiting.

Once the async task is completed, its callback is placed into the Callback Queue or Microtask Queue.

The Event Loop continuously checks whether the Call Stack is empty. If it is empty, the Event Loop moves the callback from the queue to the Call Stack for execution.

So, JavaScript remains single-threaded, but with the help of Web APIs and the Event Loop, it can handle asynchronous tasks efficiently without blocking the application.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
💻 Example
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Hello");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
Output
Start
End
Hello

```
🔥 Follow-up Question
Why do Promises execute before setTimeout?

Example:

console.log(1);

setTimeout(() => console.log(2), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(3));

console.log(4);

Output:

1
4
3
2
Reason:
Promise callbacks go to the Microtask Queue.
setTimeout callbacks go to the Callback (Macrotask) Queue.
The Event Loop always executes Microtasks before Macrotasks.
The Event Loop always gives higher priority to the Microtask Queue. It first executes all microtasks and only then processes the macrotasks.  
So, even if setTimeout has a delay of 0 milliseconds, the Promise callback runs first."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. What is JavaScript Execution Context?  

"Execution Context is the environment where JavaScript code is executed. It contains all the information needed to run the code, such as variables, functions, and the value of this.

Whenever a JavaScript program starts or a function is called, JavaScript creates a new execution context for it.

Each execution context goes through two phases: the Creation Phase and the Execution Phase.

During the Creation Phase, memory is allocated for variables and functions, and the this keyword is initialized.

During the Execution Phase, the code runs line by line, and values are assigned to variables and functions are executed.

There are mainly two types of execution contexts: Global Execution Context and Function Execution Context."

Every execution context stores:

1. Variables
2. Functions
3. this keyword
4. Scope information

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔥 Types of Execution Context
1. Global Execution Context (GEC)
Created when the program starts.
Created only once.
this points to window in browsers.
In the Global Execution Context, this points to the window object.
this === window   // true
Example:

var a = 10;

This runs inside the Global Execution Context.

2. Function Execution Context (FEC)
Created whenever a function is called.
Every function call gets its own execution context.

Example:

function test() {
    console.log("Hello");
}

test();

Calling test() creates a new Function Execution Context.

------------------------------internal representation:
---------------------------------

1️⃣ Global Execution Context (GEC)

👉 Created only once when the program starts.

Example:

var a = 10;

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
}

JavaScript creates:

Global Execution Context
------------------------
a = undefined
greet = function
this = window (browser)

After that, the code starts executing.

2️⃣ Function Execution Context (FEC)

👉 Created every time a function is called.

Example:

function greet(name) {
    console.log(name);
}

greet("Arti");

When greet() is called:

Function Execution Context
--------------------------
name = "Arti"
this = window

After the function finishes, this context is removed from the call stack.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Explain Global Execution Context and Function Execution Context.

"Global Execution Context is created when the JavaScript program starts and contains global variables, functions, and the global this object. 

Function Execution Context is created whenever a function is called, and each function gets its own local variables, parameters, and this value. 
After the function execution completes, its context is removed from the call stack."

---------------------------------------------------------------

3. What happens during the Creation Phase and Execution Phase?
Every execution context in JavaScript goes through two phases: Creation Phase and Execution Phase.

In the Creation Phase, JavaScript allocates memory for variables and functions and initializes the this keyword.   
Variables declared with var get undefined, while function declarations are stored completely in memory.

In the Execution Phase, JavaScript executes the code line by line, assigns actual values to variables, and runs function calls."

💻 Example
var a = 10;

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
}

greet();
🟢 Creation Phase

JavaScript prepares memory:

a = undefined
greet = complete function
this = window (in browser)

No code is executed yet.

🔵 Execution Phase

Now JavaScript runs the code line by line:

a = 10;
greet();

Output:

Hello



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. What is Hoisting?
"Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during the creation phase of the execution context.

Because of this, we can access var variables before their declaration, but their value will be undefined.  
Function declarations are completely hoisted, so we can call them before defining them in the code."  
Example:  
💻 Example 1: var
console.log(a);

var a = 10;
Output:
undefined
Why?

Internally, JavaScript treats it like:

var a;      // Hoisted

console.log(a); // undefined

a = 10;
💻 Example 2: Function Declaration
greet();

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
}
Output:
Hello

Because the entire function is stored in memory during the creation phase.

💻 Example 3: let and const
console.log(name);

let name = "Arti";
Output:
ReferenceError

let and const are also hoisted, but they stay in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until their declaration is reached.  

```
Hoisting = Memory Allocation Before Execution  

var    → undefined  
function → complete function  
let/const → TDZ (cannot access before declaration)
```
